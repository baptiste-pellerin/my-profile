                <p>
                    As a first-year student in the Grande Ecole Program at IÃ‰SEG School of Management and with a particular interest in entrepreneurship, having developed a business focused on buying and reselling sneakers, I am currently searching for a 2 months internship opportunity starting in June 2023.

                <h1 class="margin-bottom">A sneakers part</h1>
                <p>
                    2 years ago, in 2020, I started a sneakers business. The mechanic of this business is simple: I buy sneakers at their retail price and I sell them at a resell price, in function of laws of supply and demand. In this way I realize a profit and reinvest it into my business to buy more sneakers.

                <h1 class="margin-bottom">A finance part</h1>
                <p>
                    When I started my sneakers business, I also became interested in the world of finance, particularly cryptocurrencies and NFTs. I analyze the markets and make bets on both the rise and fall to make profits. Additionally, I am currently brainstorming a NFT project.

                <h1 class="margin-bottom">A development part</h1>
                <p>
                    In order to better manage my finances and investments in my sneaker business, I challenged myself to develop an accounting and inventory management software using Excel. After over 2 months of coding, resolving hundreds of errors, and writing over 3500 lines of code, I can finally track my KPIs to better monitor my business.
